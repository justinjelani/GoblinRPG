#Goblin-RPG

Read this before playing/editing!

My first real "game" as I am teaching myself C++. Took me around 30 minutes to an hour to put together, and I spent some extra time refining things and balancing the game. In the future, I am going to turn this text-based game into a full 2D application and hopefully put it out there for everybody to play for free.

In Goblin RPG, ou and the goblin take turns attacking each other and you can use 4 different abilities to help you defeat him! The game is very straightforward, using the number keys to make your move selection.

Important notes:
- Whenever the player flees, it is an automatic death because that is cowardly.
- The player will always have the chance to attack or use an ability first before the goblin attacks
- I decided that when the player uses an ability, that counts as a turn. This makes the game a little more difficult to manage when to use certain abilities or to attack instead.
- On death, you can either quit the program or "respawn" (all your stats are wiped and you start back at level 1)
